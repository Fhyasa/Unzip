## Unzip Automation Tool

This is a simple tool that automates the process of unzipping files from specified directories. It supports multiple directories and automatically organizes extracted files into folders when needed.

### Features
- **Automatic Unzipping**: Enter folder paths, and the tool handles extracting all ZIP files within those directories.
- **Folder Creation**: If a ZIP file contains multiple items, it creates a separate folder for those files.
- **Multi-directory Support**: Input multiple directories by separating paths with a "/" and process all ZIP files at once.

### Usage

1. **Run the .exe**: Simply download and run the provided executable file.
2. **Enter Directory Paths**: When prompted, input the paths to the directories containing your ZIP files. Use "/" to separate multiple paths.
3. **Watch It Work**: The tool will unzip all files in the specified directories. If a ZIP file has more than one item, it will automatically create a folder to hold the extracted content.


### Requirements
- Windows OS
- The .exe file of the script (no installation needed)

### How It Works
The tool looks for ZIP files in the specified directories. If it finds a ZIP file with more than one item, it creates a new folder with the same name as the ZIP file. Otherwise, it extracts the content directly into the same directory.
